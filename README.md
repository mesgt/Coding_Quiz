# Supernatural fan quiz
Multiple choice quiz over two main characters in a long running TV series- Supernatural.

## Overview
Many claim to be true fans of a highly popular, 15 season TV series Supernatural, but do they really know the actors behind Sam and Deam Winchester? This multiple choice quiz will challenge even the most dedicated fans.

Utilizing Java Script and basic CSS style elements, the website has a clean and organized look to avoid needless distractions from the content. A timer is displayed at the top of the page, counting down from 60 seconds. 

Each question is presented one at a time with answers displayed on buttons for easy selection. When the user selects their answer and clicks on the button, a message is displayed indicating whether they are correct. Every wrong answer further decreases the time allowed by 5 seconds. 

Following the final question, the user will see their final score and have the option to save it to local storage by entering their initials and clicking submit.

When the score is recorded, the user is taken to a new page where they can see a list of all scores. Two buttons will offer the user a choice to either reset the content of the High Score page or return to beginning of the quiz.
